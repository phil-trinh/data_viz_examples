# Class Survey
During our first week of class in MSDS 622 - Data Visualization, we had a survey of questions provided by the professor. Based on this data, we can explore whatever we want.

I wanted to compare the density of responses among different age groups of their anticipated hours to spend on assignments and the comfort level of presenting. All groups have the most density around 3 hours to spend on assignments and above average comfort (around a score of 4, 5 being the highest). When splitting the age groups, I made sure each group had close to the same amount of observations. 

The youngest age group had the smallest spread except for a couple of outliers, the middle age group had the biggest spread, and the oldest age group was in the middle for spread but had a couple outliers, as well. I kept the design tight and simple while differentiating the colors as much as possible. I matched the label colors with the group colors to distinguish the groups and avoided using too many groups that may clutter the plot.
