The data was clean and straightforward, providing the amount of CO2 expelled into the air by European country and in which sector of activity from 2005 to 2017. I first saw that in all years, combustion of fuels was the top ranking sector of activity (top left plot) and so I wanted to see what countries were to culprits.

The bar plot (bottom left_ and map (right) were quantitative and qualitative plots to show, by country, how much each was burning fuels in  CO2 emissions. At the bottom of the Tableau dashboard, there’s a slider for changing the plots to the respective year, starting from 2005 through 2017. The “play button” will scroll through the years and change the plots to the year. This dashboard gives a simple way of looking at the major culprit by far for CO2 emissions than any other sector, combustion of fuels, and which countries, quantifiably and geographically, are the major contributors to burning fuels over the span of 12 years.

From scrolling through all the years, Germany has always been at the top of the list, being the biggest contributor to CO2 emissions through fuel combustion. Yet, after 2012, all countries have been on a trend to reducing their carbon footprint. I used the color red to denote the darker the red, the worse the amount of CO2 is. Also, by clicking on a country either on the map or on the bar chart will filter the data to that country, adding another layer of interaction for the user.
