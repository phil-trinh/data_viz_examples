# SF Housing Rental Deals
Data given was a scrape of Craigslist listings of housing rentals in the Bay Area and Los Angeles. Craigslist is dirty and so I had to clean and make assumptions about the validity of the data. Based on the housing rentals, I wanted to see what would be a roughly good deal or not to rent in the San Francisco/Bay Area.

I fit a linear regression model  on the location, square footage, number of bedrooms & bathrooms. If pets allowed and garage availability are also taken into consideration. Based on this regression model, I predicted prices for each listing. I filtered postings that are not deleted and only within the Bay Area longitude/latitude bounding box. If actual prices are above the regression predicted price, the marker turns red and actual prices below are blue.

At a quick glance, downtown San Francisco has the greatest density of red, or high-rent locations, in the Bay Area. The farther and residential areas look to be more reasonable in rent prices. Some other clusters of high-rent locations are in Pleasanton, the inner part of South Bay closest to the Bay, and parts of Berkeley.

I chose the red and blue scale color bar for easy interpretation of high and low values, along with a default zoom to the San Francisco/Bay Area. The plot is an interactive Plotly plot so users can zoom in and out along with hovering their cursor over any point and see the listingâ€™s information. This would help users to determine how good of a deal each listing is in comparison to the rest of the Bay Area listings.
